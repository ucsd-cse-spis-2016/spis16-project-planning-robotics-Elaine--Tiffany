Robotics Lab, Elaine and Tiffany, Mentor: David Le

Idea #1: 
Design a robot that maneuvers around a certain color obstacle and hits a different color obstacle out of the way while going through a maze.

Idea #2:
Design a robot that comes when called and does cool tricks.

Idea #3:
Find an object of specific color. (scavenger hunt)

Idea #4:
build an igloo using temperature sensors to figure out where the ice is


have the robot find its way through an obstacle course (robot finds its way through light sensors seeing all the leds flashing), find objects, build something using objects, come to us when called.


things you can do with a robot:
obstacle detection
drawing
maze
room coverage (movement in all four directions)
can incorporate leds - button, seven segment display, led lights
sensors can detect: light, motion, temperature, and sound
