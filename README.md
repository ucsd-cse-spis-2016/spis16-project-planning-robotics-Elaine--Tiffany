#Brief Description
We are planning to create an obstacle course that the robot has to navigate through using an ultrasonic sensor placed on a servo. If we have time and it is available, we will use a camera to detect color and have the robot do different things to obstacles of different colors. Otherwise, 

Idea #4:
****** (this or idea number 2 for now) have the robot find its way through an obstacle course (robot finds its way through light sensors seeing all the leds flashing or use led colors to lead the robot through), find objects, build something using objects, come to us when called (when it detects motion from us) or find an object and push towards a specific spot.
More advanced - use seven segment display to show how many objects still need to be found

first stage: get the robot to turn when it gets too close to an obstacle
second stage: If we get the camera to work, have the robot do different things in front of different colored objects. Otherwise, set up a few obstacles and test different types of obstacle avoidance.
third stage:

put ultrasonic sensor on servo
---------------------
things you can do with a robot:
obstacle detection
drawing
maze
room coverage (movement in all four directions)
can incorporate leds - button, seven segment display, led lights
sensors can detect: light, motion, temperature, and sound (ultrasonic sensor)
Idea #1: 
Design a robot that maneuvers around a certain color obstacle and hits a different color obstacle out of the way while going through a maze.

Idea #2:
Design a robot that comes when called (when it detects motion from us) and does cool tricks.

Idea #3:
Find an object of specific color. (scavenger hunt)
